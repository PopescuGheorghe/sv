Variables that start with the @ sign, called instance variables, are automatically available in the views

2.4.1 What we learned in this chapter

Scaffolding automatically creates code to model data and interact with it through the web.
Scaffolding is good for getting started quickly but is bad for understanding.
Rails uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for structuring web applications.
As interpreted by Rails, the REST architecture includes a standard set of URLs and controller actions for interacting with data models.
Rails supports data validations to place constraints on the values of data model attributes.
Rails comes with built-in functions for defining associations between different data models.
We can interact with Rails applications at the command line using the Rails console.
